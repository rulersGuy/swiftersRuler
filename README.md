- **Recommended range:** 16-100

- `25` - Slightly faster
- `50` - Fast walking
- `100` - Very fast (use with caution)

## üîß Customization

### GUI Version Customization:
```lua
local config = {
    minSpeed = 0,        -- Minimum slider value
    maxSpeed = 100,      -- Maximum slider value
    currentSpeed = 16,   -- Starting speed
    keybind = Enum.KeyCode.X, -- Toggle key (change X to any key)
    enabled = true
}
```

### Simple Version Customization:
```lua
local WALKSPEED = 50  -- Your desired speed
local KEYBIND = "Q"   -- Your keybind (A-Z)
```

## üìã Keybinds

### One-liner Multiple Speeds:
- `1` - Speed 16 (default)
- `2` - Speed 25
- `3` - Speed 50
- `4` - Speed 100

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Script Not Working?
1. Make sure you're in a game, not the Roblox menu
2. Ensure your character has spawned
3. Check if the game has anti-cheat that blocks walkspeed changes
4. Try executing the script again after respawning

### GUI Not Showing?
1. Press the toggle key (X by default)
2. Check if the GUI was destroyed - re-run the script
3. Make sure you're using a compatible executor

### Speed Not Applying?
1. Some games reset walkspeed frequently - the script handles most cases
2. Try the simple version if the GUI version doesn't work
3. Some games may have server-side restrictions

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Cheat & Safety Information

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Some games have strict anti-cheat systems that can:
- **Detect walkspeed modifications** and ban your account
- **Cause system freezes** on PC/mobile devices
- **Crash your game** or script executor

### Games with Strong Anti-Cheat:
- **Adopt Me** - Very strict detection
- **Arsenal** - Advanced anti-cheat, risk of bans
- **Jailbreak** - Sophisticated monitoring
- **Phantom Forces** - Military-grade protection

### **RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**
1. **Always start with `safe_walkspeed_changer.lua`** - has built-in protections
2. **Test in private servers first**
3. **Use conservative speeds (18-25 range)**
4. **Read `troubleshooting_guide.md` for game-specific solutions**

### Emergency Reset (if system freezes):
```lua
-- Paste this immediately if something goes wrong
game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 16
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Use Responsibly:** Don't use extreme speeds that could disrupt gameplay for others
2. **Game Compatibility:** Some games may have anti-cheat systems that detect or prevent walkspeed changes
3. **Server Rules:** Always follow the rules of the games you're playing
4. **Executor Required:** These scripts require a Roblox script executor to run
5. **System Safety:** Monitor your device performance and stop if experiencing lag/freezing

## üîÑ Updates

The scripts automatically handle:
- Character respawning
- Death/reset events
- Game teleportation (in most cases)
